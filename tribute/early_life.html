        <p>Diana Frances Spencer was born on July 1, 1961, at Park House, Sandringham, Norfolk, England. She was the
            fourth
            of five children of John Spencer, Viscount Althorp, and Frances Spencer, Viscountess Althorp (later known
            as
            the Honorable Frances Shand Kydd).</p>
        <p>Diana's childhood was marked by her parents' divorce when she was just eight years old. Despite the
            challenges,
            she remained a bright and compassionate young girl, foreshadowing the remarkable woman she would become.</p>
