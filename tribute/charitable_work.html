        <p>Diana was renowned for her extensive charitable work. She devoted herself to numerous causes, using her
            platform
            to make a positive impact on the world.</p>
        <p>One of her most notable contributions was her involvement in raising awareness about AIDS. In the late 1980s,
            when misconceptions about the disease were widespread, Diana played a crucial role in changing public
            perception and breaking down the stigma associated with AIDS.</p>
        <p>Additionally, she championed campaigns against landmines, advocating for their global ban. Her efforts
            contributed to the signing of the Ottawa Treaty in 1997, which aimed to eliminate the use of anti-personnel
            landmines worldwide.</p>
